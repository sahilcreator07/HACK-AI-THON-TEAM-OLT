      " Objectives and General Principles  \n",
      "(i) The primary objective of t he Bank’s NPA management policy will be to maintain its entire loan portfolio as ‘Standard Asset’, or zero level of ‘NPA’ as \n",
      "per RBI definition. The bank will endeavour to take measures in a planned and proactive manner, to prevent the ‘Standard asse ts’ fr om slipping into \n",
      "the category of ‘Sub -standard Asset’ or even ‘Watch list asset’. The preventive measures are based on the Early Warning System in accordance with \n",
      "RBI guidelines and the best international practices.  \n",
      " \n",
      "(ii) A critical component of the Bank’s NPA management policy relates to corrective measures to be taken with respect to loan asse ts that are impaired / \n",
      "classified as NPAs. The main objective of the corrective measures will be to minimize the NPAs level as a pe rcentage of the Bank’s total loan assets \n",
      "and contain it within the target set by the Bank, from year to year. The corrective measures include loan up -gradation by debt restructuring/ re -\n",
      "habilitation, exit option, settlement/ compromise, legal recovery acti on, and write -offs of the NPAs.  \n",
      " \n",
      "(iii) The overall NPA management policy is based on the following principles:  \n",
      "a. Early recognition, identification and reporting of the borrower accounts as per RBI’s asset classification.  \n",
      "b. Documenting the primary causes (as disting uished from symptoms) of each of the problem loans and the attendant risks.  \n",
      "c. Taking preventive / corrective steps to effectively mitigate the risk involved in the impaired accounts, with the concurrence  / approval of the \n",
      "designated sanctioning authorities.  \n",
      "d. Recovery of the Bank’s dues from the borrowers / guarantors / charged assets, or exercising exit option appropriately to mini mize the loss to \n",
      "the Bank.  \n",
      "e. Provisioning for the expected loss from default by the borrowers.  \n",
      "f. Writing off – partially or fully – the ‘Loss Assets’ against the provisions already made.  \n",
      "g. Documenting learning lessons from the typical NPA case studies, using them in the Credit training courses and circulating nec essary guidelines \n",
      "for preventing their recurrence.  \n",
      "h. Conducting Staff Accountabi lity Reviews once an account becomes a Loss.  \n",

      " Early Warning System (EWS)  \n",
      "(i) The Bank will follow the EWS for early identification of problem loans, as it enables the Bank:  \n",
      " To take corrective measures before the position becomes irretrievable,  \n",
      " To minimize the risk of loss,  \n",
      " To improve the prospects of recovery in the event of possible default.  \n",
      " \n",
      "(ii) The Relationship Manager (RM) and the Business Segment Head concerned with the particular loan would be responsible for:  \n",
      " Identifying and documenting the primary causes fo r the decline in the financial position of the borrower,  \n",
      " Assessing realistically the borrower’s ability to rectify the position within a time frame.  \n",
      " \n",
      "(iii) The Bank would classify accounts facing deterioration in credit as ‘Watch list accounts’. This will includ e accounts in which the future prospects are \n",
      "in doubt on account of:  \n",
      " Adverse industry trends on account of any direct/ indirect government policies, sudden threat of substitutes, general weaknes s in demand of \n",

      " ‘Out of Order’ Status:  \n",
      "An account would be treated as 'out of order' if the outstanding  balance remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit/drawing power. In \n",
